                Welcome UCI faculty, family, friends and most importantly, class of 2025. First off, Happy Father’s Day to all the dads in the crowd. Today we celebrate a momentous achievement, the centuries-old tradition of commencement and years of hard work and dedication poured into your education. My name is Sabrina and I’m honored to be graduating alongside my fellow Anteaters. I’d like to first thank my family and friends for endless support throughout this journey and to the amazing UCI community which has been forged by the hardworking professors, teaching assistants, and administration. 
            Four years ago, I stepped foot on this campus and like many of you, I had no idea who I was or what I wanted to do with my life. During my time at UCI, I’ve had the privilege of learning, growing and challenging myself to be a better scholar, thinker and human being. I’ve had the freedom to pursue knowledge and think with an open mind. I’ve experienced the support from an institution that fosters curiosity, hard work, and creativity. Most of all, I’ve lived a college life that has made me champion the values of academic freedom, equitable access, and science. 
            And I’m here speaking to all of you because of all the women who came before me, who did not have these same privileges but have sacrificed and fought to give me this life. I’m here speaking because there are girls in my home country of Vietnam, girls who look just like me, but cannot afford the same opportunities that I can in this country. I’m here speaking because this degree was never about being able to make a living wage. This degree was earned by all of us so that we may continue on as leaders, innovators, and visionaries that stand up for education and equity. So when fear and bigotry threaten the exercise of independent thought and aims to curb access to opportunity across the globe, I am confident that my class of 2025 will rise to the challenge. This degree is only one step toward a brighter future where we tackle obstacles with strength and our shared humanity. From today on, we will forever be connected as lifelong learners, problem solvers, and most importantly Anteaters. Thank you class of 2025 for everything you have given me and congratulations on your achievement.
